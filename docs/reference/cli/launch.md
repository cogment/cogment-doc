# Launch

Launch is a utility command meant to facilitate locally launching and shutting down an entire Cogment project at once.

When launch is used, a set of processes will be launched to run in parallel, as described by a [YAML definition file](#definition-file).
Once any of these processes terminates, all other ones will be terminated as well.

The order of script launches is undefined, which is to say that they may not start in the order they are defined, and may not always start in the same order.

## Command line

`cogment launch [options] filename [args...]`

`filename`: Name (and path) of the YAML definition file describing the processes to launch.

`options`:

[-q], [--quiet]: Disable some of the output generated by the launcher. Process output is never disabled by this option. To increase the level, more "q" can be added, up to `-qqq` disabling all launcher generated output except errors.

`args`: These are arguments that will be used in [variable substitution](#variable-substitution) in the definition file.

E.g.:

```console
$ cogment launch -qq ./launch.yaml 1000 8
```

## definition file

The launch definition file is a [YAML](https://yaml.org) formatted file where the details of the parallel processes to run are defined.
The file consists of at least a `scripts` top level node, and may also contain a `global` top level node.

### Nodes

#### Scripts

The `scripts` node contains the details of the processes to run.
Each node under `scripts` represents a process to run.
The name of the node becomes the identity of the script/process and serves to identify the process output.

Each process will run the contents of the `commands` list in sequence (i.e. the next command will start when the previous ends). Each command runs in an independent environment (e.g. environment variables set by one command will not be seen by the others).

E.g.:

```yaml
scripts:
    process_a:  # The name of this process is "process_a"
        commands:
            - ["retrieve_db.sh"]
            - ["python3", "env/main.py"]

    process_b:  # The name of this process is "process_b"
        commands:
            - ["cogment", "service", "orchestrator"]
```

The output will then look something like this:

```output
2023-06-30T22:24:08Z [TRACE ] [process_a:(1/2)] Launch [retrieve_db.sh]
2023-06-30T22:24:08Z [stdout] [process_a:(1/2)] Retrieving default database...
2023-06-30T22:24:08Z [TRACE ] [process_b:(1/1)] Launch [cogment services orchestrator]
2023-06-30T22:24:08Z [stderr] [process_b:(1/1)] 2023-06-30T22:24:08Z [INFO] [cmd] starting the orchestrator service [version:2.16.0]
2023-06-30T22:24:09Z [stderr] [process_a:(1/2)] Record #2278 inconsistent
2023-06-30T22:24:12Z [stdout] [process_a:(1/2)] Database retrieved in /app/sb/
2023-06-30T22:24:12Z [TRACE ] [process_a:(1/2)] Completed
2023-06-30T22:24:12Z [TRACE ] [process_a:(2/2)] Launch [python3 env/main.py]
...
```

Notes:

- "[TRACE ]" is low level information from the launcher (it could also be "[INFO  ]" for more important information).
- "[stdout]", and "[stderr]" are the output from the process.
- "process_a" and "process_b" are the names given to the processes in the definition file.
- "(1/2)" means that it is the first command out of two for that process.
- The times/dates are in RFC3339 format.

##### Environment Variables

You can set environment variables using the `environment` node of the process.
These will be part of the environment of all commands in the process.

E.g:

```yaml
scripts:
    orchestrator:
        environment:
            COGMENT_ORCHESTRATOR_ACTOR_PORT: 9000
            COGMENT_LIFECYCLE_PORT: 9000
        commands:
            - ["cogment", "services", "orchestrator"]
```

##### Working folder

By default, the current working folder is set to the folder **containing the launch definition file** (not the folder where the Launch command is executed).
You can change the working folder with the `folder` node for each process.
<!-- The `dir` node is deprecated. -->

E.g.:

```yaml
# Definition file is in "/home/user"
scripts:
    actor_alpha:
        folder: ./actors/alpha  # Working folder is "/home/user/actors/alpha"
        commands:
            - ["python3", "main.py"]
```

##### Quiet

You can control the process output by setting this value to `True` or `False`.
By default this is `False`, in which case standard process output (stdout and stderr) are also output by the launcher.
If set to `True`, standard process output is discarded and not output by the launcher.

E.g.:

```yaml
scripts:
    setup:
        quiet: True
        commands:
            - ["python3", "setup.py"]
```

##### Dependency *(Cogment >= 2.16)*

Inter-process dependency can also be defined using the `depends_on` and `ready_output` nodes of the script.

The `depends_on` node is a list of process names that this script depends on.
Which means that all the listed processes must be "ready" before the current process is started.

The `ready_output` node is a regex (regular expression) string to search for in the output of the process.
When the regex matches the output, the process is considered to be "ready".
If no regex string is provided (or the regex string is empty), the process is considered "ready" as soon as it starts.

E.g.:

```yaml
scripts:
    process_a:
        commands:
            - ["retrieve_db.sh"]
            - ["python3", "env/main.py"]
        ready_output: '^Database retrieved in'

    process_b:
        depends_on:
            - process_a
        commands:
            - ["cogment", "service", "orchestrator"]
```

Notes:

- It is better to use single quotes to define the regex string to prevent YAML from interpreting control characters (e.g. backslash).
- Be aware that colors in the process output can make matching difficult.
- The version of regex currently used mostly follows [Google's RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).
- The `quiet` option (if enabled), does not prevent the matching of the process output.

#### Global *(Cogment >= 2.15)*

The `global` node contains values that have a global scope (i.e. they affect all scripts defined in the file).
Some of these values can be overridden by the individual scripts.

##### Environment Variables

You can set global environment variables using the `environment` node under the `global` node.
These variables will be part of the environment of all scripts, unless overridden locally in the script's own `environment` node.

E.g:

```yaml
global:
    environment:
        COGMENT_LOG_LEVEL: info
        COGMENT_DIRECTORY_ENDPOINT: grpc://server:9010
```

##### Working folder

By default, the current working folder is set to the folder **containing the launch definition file** (not the folder where the Launch command is executed).
This can be changed with the `folder` node under the `global` node.
It will then become the default folder for all scripts, unless locally changed by the script's own `folder` node.
Each level can also build on the previous one if the provided folder is a relative folder.

E.g.:

```yaml
# Definition file is in "/home/user"
global:
    folder: ./app  # Default folder for all scripts is set to "/home/user/app"
scripts:
    local:
        folder: ./inside  # Working folder is then "/home/user/app/inside"
    somewhere:
        folder: /home/away  # Working folder is then "/home/away"
```

### Variable substitution

<!-- This is using the go 'text.template' facility with the environment variables as dictionary -->
You can substitute environment variables using `{{.ENV_VAR}}` anywhere in the `commands`, `environment` or `ready_output` values.
Environment variables set in the definition file can also be substituted that way.

To print the literal double curly open brackets, surround them with backticks inside substitution brackets: ```{{`{{`}}```.

E.g.:

```yaml
# "USER=Elvis" is a variable in the environment where "cogment launch" was run
scripts:
    say_hi:
        environment:
            TYPE: "How"
            QUESTION: "{{.TYPE}} are you?"
        commands:
            - ["echo", "Hello, {{.USER}}. {{.QUESTION}}"]  # echo "Hello, Elvis. How are you?"
            - ["echo", "{{`{{`}} brackets }}"]  # echo "{{ brackets }}"
        ready_output: 'Hello, {{.USER}}.*'
```

Undefined values will be replaced with `<no value>`.

#### Arguments *(Cogment >= 2.15)*

You can also substitute the arguments from the command line of launch (e.g. `cogment launch ./launch.yaml arg1 arg2 arg3`) using `{{.__1}}`, `{{.__2}}`, `{{.__3}}`, etc.
Note that the `{{.__1}}` to `{{.__9}}` are always defined, but will be empty if no corresponding argument was given on the command line.
Arguments 10 (`{{.__10}}`) and above will only be defined if they were provided on the command line.

E.g.:

```console
$ cogment launch ./launch.yaml 42 foo
```

```yaml
scripts:
    args_out:
        environment:
            NAME: foo
        commands:
            - ["echo", "args: {{.__1}} {{.__2}} {{.__3}}"]  # echo "args: 42 foo "
            - ["echo", "no args: {{.__10}}"]  # echo "no args: <no value>"
        ready_output: '.* {{.__2}}$'
```

global:
    environment:
        RUN_NAME: "COGRUN-{{.HOSTNAME}}-{{.__1}}"
