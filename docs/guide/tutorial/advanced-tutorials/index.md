title: Advanced Tutorial Steps
---

This section offers an interested reader a set of advanced tutorials to learn how about how to do more complex things with Cogment. These tutorials build off of the RPS basics tutorial, so it may be useful to follow these.

You can use the more advanced tutorials in a "choose your own adventure" style:

-   [Have a human player in the loop](./6-human-player.md)
-   [Build a web interface for a human player to access your Cogment app](./7-web-client.md)
-   [Improve operational efficiency by using more advanced Cogment tooling for service discovery](./8-directory.md)

The steps above are in order of increasing complexity, but you need not necessarily complete all of them. You can get a working starting point by following the [installation instructions](../1-setup.md) and copying the code for the desired step of the tutorial you'd like to explore.
