# Development guide

This document gives a high level view of what it is to develop a Cogment based application using Cogment SDKs. It assumes the reader is familiar with the [Cogment core concepts](../guide/core-concepts.md).

:::note
Some features aren't available in Javascript, if there's only Python examples under a certain section, that feature is python only.
:::

The High-level Cogment API expects users to use [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) to declare a project's data structures. The intricacies of protobufs are beyond the scope of this document. Basic knowledge of the technology and its usage is assumed.

## The spec file

The spec file, usually named `cogment.yaml`, defines the specifics of a type of trials for a Cogment app: actor classes as well as environment & trial configuration types. It is the starting point for a project.

An actor class is primarily defined by its observation space and action space.

The data structures describing these spaces are declared by using a protocol buffer message type. [Observations and actions](../guide/core-concepts.md#observations--actions) will simply be instances of the matching type.

For example, in the following, `driver` and `pedestrian` share a common view of the environment, hence use the same observation space, but have different actions available to them.

```yaml
import:
  proto:
    - city.proto

actors:
  driver:
    observation:
      space: city.Observation

    action:
      space: city.DriverAction

  pedestrian:
    observation:
      space: city.Observation

    action:
      space: city.PedestrianAction
```

:::tip
This shows only the relevant part of the full spec file, you can find the full list of configurable options [in the reference page](../reference/cogment-yaml.md).
:::

### Compiling the spec file

In order to use the spec file within the various supported languages, it needs to be compiled. This is done by the code generation modules of the specific language's SDK you are using.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

For the python SDK, the generation step requires an [extra](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/#extras) from the `cogment` package. Using pip you can install the SDK with its extra using:

```console
pip install cogment[generate]
```

The generation can then be executed using:

```console
python -m cogment.generate cogment.yaml
```

This will create a `cog_settings.py` file as well as multiple `*_pb.py` files.

  </TabItem>
<TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

For the Javascript SDK, the generation requires the SDK to be installed:

```console
npm install @cogment/cogment-js-sdk
```

The generation can then be executed using:

```console
npx cogment-js-sdk-generate cogment.yaml
```

This will create several files in the `src` folder: `CogSettings.js`, `CogSettings.d.ts`, `CogSettings.d.ts.map` and `CogTypes.d.ts` as well multiple `*_pb.js` and `*_pb.d.ts` files.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Environment

[Environments](../guide/core-concepts.md#environment) are implemented by functions that take a _environment session_ instance.

This function will be called once for each [trial](../guide/core-concepts.md#trial). This function usually consists of three sections.

- The environment's **initialization**, where its internal state can be initialized and processes started. It ends with the sending of the initial observations to the actors participating in the trial.
- Its **event loop**, where the environment iterates through the events occurring during the trial and produces [observations](../guide/core-concepts.md#observations--actions) as well as receives messages. In this loop the environment can end the trial on its own or the end can be requested, see the [Trial lifetime](#trial-lifetime) section for further information.
- Its **termination**, where cleanup occurs.

In the common case where all actors within a trial share the same observation, a bare-minimum environment service would look like this:

```python
async def environment(environment_session):
  # -- Initialization --

  # Retrieve the actors participating in the trial
  actors = environment_session.get_active_actors()

  # Start the trial and send a starting observation to all actors
  environment_session.start([("*", Observation())])

  # -- Event loop --
  async for event in environment_session.all_events():
    if event.actions:
      # `event.actions` is a list of the actions done by the actors
      actions = event.actions
      if event.type == cogment.EventType.ACTIVE:
        # The trial is active, produce an observation in response to the actions
        environment_session.produce_observations([("*", Observation())])
        # Alternatively the environment can decide to **end** the trial with the following
        # environment_session.end([("*", Observation())])
      else:
        # The trial termination has been requested
        # Produce a final observation
        environment_session.end([("*", Observation())])

    for message in event.messages:
      # `event.messages` is a list of all the messages received by the environment (it can be empty)

      # Handle each message here.

  # -- Termination --
  print(f"Trial [{environment_session.get_trial_id()}] terminated")
```

For further details, take a look at the [`cogment.EnvironmentSession`](../reference/python.md#class-environmentsessionsession) class reference.

This environment implementation needs to be registered and served so that the [Orchestrator](../guide/core-concepts.md#orchestrator) can reach it. This can be done through a `Context` instance.

```python
context = cogment.Context(user_id="my_user_id", cog_settings=cog_settings)

context.register_environment(impl=environment, impl_name="my_environment")

await context.serve_all_registered(cogment.ServedEndpoint(port=9000))
```

For further details, take a look at the [`cogment.Context`](../reference/python.md#class-cogmentcontext) class reference.

### Sending observations

The environment session has 3 different methods able to send observations: `start`, `produce_observations` and `end`. Each of those methods takes a list of 2-tuples destination / observation.

As demonstrated above, sending the same observation to all actors is done using `"*"` as the destination.

```python
environment_session.produce_observations([("*", Observation(...))])
```

It is also possible to send different observations to different actors. This can be useful to send observations of the _world_ from the point of view of the actor or to send partial observations.

```python
environment_session.produce_observations([
  ("my_first_actor_name", Observation(...)),
  ("my_second_actor_name", Observation(...))
])
```

Please note that the environment should always send observations such as each actor in the trial receives one.

## Actor

[Actors](../guide/core-concepts.md#actor) implementations look a lot like the [environment's](#environment). They take _actor session_ instance and have the same three sections: **initialization**, **event loop** and **termination**.

The event loops in Actors' implementations handle three basic types of events:

- `observation` produced by the environment and should lead to an action being done.
- `rewards` sent by other actors or the environment, we'll talk about them in more details [below](#reward).
- `messages` sent by other actors or the environment, we'll talk about them in more details [below](#messages).

A typical actor implementation would look like this:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
async def driver_actor(actor_session):
  # -- Initialization --

  # Notify that the actor is ready for the trial to start.
  actor_session.start()

  async for event in actor_session.all_events():
    if event.observation:
      # `event.observation` is an instance of the Observation produced by the environment
      observation = event.observation
      if event.type == cogment.EventType.ACTIVE:
        # The trial is active, it is expecting the agent to do an action
        actor_session.do_action(DriverAction(...))

    for reward in event.rewards:
      # `event.rewards` is a list of all the rewards received by the actor (it can be empty)

      # Handle each reward here.

    for message in event.messages:
      # `event.messages` is a list of all the messages received by the actor (it can be empty)

      # Handle each message here.

  # -- Termination --
  print(f"Trial [{actor_session.get_trial_id()}] terminated")
```

For further details, take a look at the [`cogment.ActorSession`](../reference/python.md#class-actorsessionsession) class reference.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

```javascript
const driverActor = async (actorSession) => {
  // -- Initialization --

  // Notify that the actor is ready for the trial to start.
  actorSession.start();

  for await (const event of actorSession.eventLoop()) {
    if (event.observation) {
      // `event.observation` is an instance of the Observation produced by the environment
      observation = event.observation;
      if (event.type === cogment.EventType.ACTIVE) {
        // The trial is active, it is expecting the agent to do an action
        actorSession.sendAction(new DriverAction());
      }
    }
    for (const reward of event.rewards) {
      // `event.rewards` is a list of all the rewards received by the actor (it can be empty)
      // Handle each reward here.
    }
    for (const message of event.messages) {
      // `event.messages` is a list of all the messages received by the actor (it can be empty)
      // Handle each message here.
    }
  }

  // -- Termination --
  console.log(`Trial [${actorSession.getTrialId()}] terminated`);
};
```

For further details, take a look at the [`ActorSession`](../reference/javascript.md#class-actorsession-extends-session) class reference.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Service actor / Client actor

A Cogment app can use two types of actors, they are identical in terms of implementation but differ in how they interact with the app's [Orchestrator](../guide/core-concepts.md#orchestrator).

**Service actors** are accessible in the same way the environment is, through a [`Context`](../reference/python.md#class-cogmentcontext) instance.

```python
context = cogment.Context(cog_settings=cog_settings, user_id="my_user_id")
context.register_actor(impl=actor, impl_name="driver_actor", actor_classes=["driver"])
context.register_actor(impl=actor_slow, impl_name="driver_actor_slow", actor_classes=["driver"])

await context.serve_all_registered(cogment.ServedEndpoint(port=9000))
```

Note that it is also through this registrating that the implementation is associated with one or more actor classes it implements.

**Client actors**, contrary to Service actors, are not served to the [Orchestrator](../guide/core-concepts.md#orchestrator). They connect as clients of the Orchestrator and join a [trial](../guide/core-concepts.md#trial) that has started.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
context = cogment.Context(cog_settings=cog_settings, user_id="my_user_id")
context.register_actor(
  impl=actor,
  impl_name="human_pedestrian",
  actor_classes=["pedestrian"]
)

await context.join_trial(
  trial_id=trial_id,
  cogment.Endpoint(url="grpc://orchestrator:9000"),
  actor_name="Alice"
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

```javascript
const context = new Context(cogSettings, "my_user_id");

context.registerActor(actorImpl, "human_pedestrian", "pedestrian");

await context.joinTrial(trialId, "grpc://orchestrator:9000", "Alice");
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that a trial including one or more client actors will wait for all of them to join before any actor can start processing events.

Due to the different network requirements, client actors are a good fit when implementing a frontend for human actors.

### Actor Availability

There are four actor parameters (see [Trial Parameters](../reference/parameters.md#parameters-reference)) to manage actor responses for a trial: `initial_connection_timeout`, `response_timeout`, `optional` and `default_action`.
The timeouts control when an actor becomes unavailable, and the other two control what happens when it becomes unavailable.

The trial will be [_hard_ terminated](#hard-termination) by the Orchestrator if a required (non-optional) actor becomes unavailable, whereas it can continue if an optional actor becomes unavailable.

The `default_action` is for optional actors; when the actor is unavailable, the default action will be sent to the environment. If there is no default action defined, the environment is informed that the actor is unavailable, but no action is provided.

E.g. If a required actor (with `optional` set to False) has a `response_timeout` set to 5.0 seconds, but takes more than 5 seconds to respond to a new observation (e.g. due to excessive computation, or a crash), then the trial will be terminated.

## Controller

[Trials](../guide/core-concepts.md#trial) are started by clients of the [Orchestrator](../guide/core-concepts.md#orchestrator) using a Controller. Instances of a controller are built from the context instance and connect to an Orchestrator endpoint.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
controller = context.get_controller(
  endpoint=cogment.Endpoint(url="grpc://orchestrator:9000")
)
```

For further details, take a look at the [`Controller`](../reference/python.md#class-controller) class reference.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

```javascript
const controller = context.getController("grpc://orchestrator:9000");
```

For further details, take a look at the [`Controller`](../reference/javascript.md#class-controller) class reference.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Start and terminate trials

The controller can then be used to create trials and request their termination.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
trial_id = await controller.start_trial(trial_config=TrialConfig())

# ...

await controller.terminate_trial([trial_id])
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

```javascript
const trialId = await controller.startTrial(new TrialConfig());

// ...

await controller.terminateTrial([trialId]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

The default behavior of the Controller's _terminate trial_ function is to trigger a [soft termination](#soft-termination), an optional `hard` parameters can be set to `True` to trigger a [hard termination](#hard-termination).

:::

#### Start trial from trial parameters

The above example uses an instance of the user-defined trial configuration to start the trial. This instance is then provided to a [pre-trial hook](#pre-trial-hook) to fully define the trial parameters. It is also possible to fully provide the trial parameters when starting the trial.

```python
actor_1_params = cogment.ActorParameters(
    cog_settings,
    name="Alice",
    class_name="pedestrian",
    endpoint="cogment://client"
)
actor_2_params = cogment.ActorParameters(
    cog_settings,
    name="ai_driver",
    class_name="driver",
    endpoint="grpc://driver_actors:9000",
    implementation="driver_actor_slow"
)

environment_config=EnvironmentConfig(
  # ...
)

trial_params=cogment.TrialParameters(
    cog_settings,
    environment_name="environment",
    environment_implementation="my_environment"
    environment_endpoint="grpc://environment:9000",
    environment_config=environment_config,
    actors=[
        actor_1_params,
        actor_2_params,
    ]
)
```

For further details, take a look at the [`cogment.TrialParameters`](../reference/python.md#class-cogmenttrialparameters) class reference.

### Watch trials

The controller can also be used to subscribe to events occuring in the trials run by the Orchestrator it connects to. For example, this can be used to wait for a trial's end:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
async for trial_info in controller.watch_trials(trial_state_filters=[
  cogment.TrialState.ENDED
]):
  print(f"The trial having id [{trial_info.trial_id}] ended")
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

```javascript
for await (const trialListEntry of controller.watchTrials([
  cogment.TrialState.ENDED,
])) {
  console.log(`The trial having id ${trialListEntry.getTrialId()} ended.`);
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Rewards

### Creating

Rewards are sent to [Actors](../guide/core-concepts.md#actor) from another actor or the [Environment](../guide/core-concepts.md#environment). The `session` instance passed to their implementation can be used for this purpose.

```python
session.add_reward(value=-1, confidence=1, tick_id=-1, to=['an_actor_name'])
```

Rewards consist of an arbitrary numerical **value** describing how the reward "sender" _believes_ the actor performed.
It is _weighted_ by a value between 0 and 1 qualifying the **confidence** of the "sender" in its reward, from a very low confidence just above 0 to a very high confidence approaching 1.
The confidence value is used to collate all the rewards sent to an actor at the same time.
Optionally, a reward can be provided with arbitrary user data.

Each reward applies to a list of recipients (either all the actors, all the actors of a given class or a specific actor) at a specific point in time, during the trial, defined as a **tick**.
The tick ID can represent a past action if the value is smaller than the current tick ID ("future" actions are not allowed).
Past actions, like sending a reward related to a past tick ID, are handled in accordance with the [nb_buffered_ticks](../reference/parameters.md#nb_buffered_ticks) trial parameter.

The full documentation for `session.add_reward` can be found [here](../reference/python.md#add_rewardself-value-confidence-to-tick_id-1-user_datanone).

### Consuming

All the Rewards that are sent and destined to each specific [actor](../guide/core-concepts.md#actor) for a given point in time are collated together by the framework.

The [actor](../guide/core-concepts.md#actor) can take into account the reward directly as the [trial](../guide/core-concepts.md#trial) is running by consuming the `"reward"` event in their event loop.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
async for event in actor_session.all_events():
  # [...]
  for reward in event.rewards:
    # `reward.tick_id` is the id of the tick this reward concerns.
    tick_id = reward.tick_id
    # `reward.value` is the aggregated value of the reward.
    value = reward.value
    for source_reward in reward.all_sources():
      # Iterate over individual source rewards.
      reward_value = source_reward.value
      reward_confidence = source_reward.confidence
      reward_sender = source_reward.sender
      reward_user_data = source_reward.user_data
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

```javascript
for await (const event of actorSession.eventLoop()) {
  // [...]
  for (const reward of event.rewards) {
    // `reward.tickId` is the id of the tick this reward concerns.
    const tickId = reward.tickId;
    // `reward.value` is the aggregated value of the reward.
    const value = reward.value;
    for (sourceReward of reward.sourcesList) {
      // Iterate over individual source rewards.
      const rewardValue = sourceReward.value;
      const rewardConfidence = sourceReward.confidence;
      const rewardSender = sourceReward.senderName;
      const rewardUserData = sourceReward.userData;
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Messages

### Creating

Messages can be created and sent between [actors](../guide/core-concepts.md#actor) or the [environment](../guide/core-concepts.md#environment) within a trial using their `session` instance.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
session.send_message(
    user_data=MyProtobufDataStructure(...), # any protobuf data structure can be used here.
    to=['pedestrian:*'], # send the message to all the actors of the "pedestrian" class
)
```

The full documentation for `session.send_message` can be found [here](../reference/python.md#send_messageself-payload-to-to_environmentfalse).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

```javascript
const message = new Message();
message.setRequest("hello");

// Now we serialize into an Any protobuf message.
const anyPb = new MyProtobufDataStructure();
anyPb.pack(message.serializeBinary(), "cogment_app.Message");

actorSession.sendMessage({
  from: actorName,
  payload: anyPb,
  to: "otherActorName",
  trialId,
});
```

The full documentation for `actorSession.sendMessage` can be found [here](../reference/javascript.md#sendmessagepayload-to).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Messages consist of an arbitrary payload, their `user_data/payload`, defined as an instance of any protobuf data structure.

A message can be sent to one, many or all actors in a trial and / or to the environment.

### Consuming

All the messages that are sent and intended for each specific actor or environment will be received by the target actor or environment.

Actors or the environment can use the message directly, live, as the [trial](../guide/core-concepts.md#trial) is running, by consuming message event in their event loop.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
async for event in actor_session.all_events():
  # [...]
  for message in event.messages:
    # `message.sender_name` is the name of the actor who sent a message
    sender_name = message.sender_name
    # `message.payload` is the content of the message, it needs to be unpacked
    payload = message.payload
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

```javascript
for await (const event of actorSession.eventLoop()) {
  // [...]
  for (const message of event.messages) {
    // `message.sender_name` is the name of the actor who sent a message
    const sender = message.sender;
    // `message.data` is the content of the message, it needs to be unpacked
    const data = message.data;

    const newMessage = data.unpack(
      (x: Uint8Array) => Message.deserializeBinary(x),
      "cogment_app.Message"
    );
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Pre-trial hook

When starting a trial from a controller, an instance of the message type defined in [`trial:config_type`](../reference/cogment-yaml.md#trial) can be provided. This instance is then passed to the registered **Pre trial hooks** when the Orcehstrator was started. The role of these hooks is to fully parametrize the trial based on the provided config. To achieve that, they can modify the default trial params defined in the [parameters](../reference/parameters.md) to specify the environment (i.e. its endpoint, implementation name & configuration), the number and parameters of the participant actors (i.e. their name, class, endpoint, implementation name & configuration) as well as additional parameters for the trial. The pre-trial hook can therefore be used to dynamically configure trials, to act as a service endpoint registry, or a load balancer.

Pre-trial hook implementations are registered in the same way the environment or actor implementation are and follow the same _session_ pattern.

```python
async def my_pre_trial_hook(pre_hook_session):
  # The trial config provided by the controller can be retrieved like that
  trial_config = pre_hook_session.trial_config
  # The trial params can be edited directly
  pre_hook_session.environment_config = # [...]
  pre_hook_session.environment_endpoint = "grpc://my_environment:9000"
  pre_hook_session.actors = [
    {
      "name": "my_first_actor_name",
      "actor_class": "driver",
      "endpoint": "grpc://driver:9000",
      "implementation": "driver_actor",
      "config": # [...],
    },
    {
      "name": "my_second_actor_name",
      "actor_class": "predestrian",
      "endpoint": "cogment://client",
      "config": # [...],
    },
  ]
  # And finally should be validated
  pre_hook_session.validate()

context.register_pre_trial_hook(impl=my_pre_trial_hook)
```

## Trial lifetime

Over their lifetime trials can be in different states managed by the Orchestrator. The current state of the trial can be accessed by a [Controler](#controler).

Possible Trial States are defined as:

- [`cogment.TrialState`](../reference/python.md#class-cogmenttrialstateenumenum) in the Python SDK.
- [`cogment.TrialState`](../reference/javascript.md#enum-cogmenttrialstate) in the Javascript SDK.
- [`cogmentAPI.TrialState`](../reference/grpc.md#trialstate) in the gRPC API.

### Trial start

The trial starts with a request from a [**Controller**](#controller) to the Orchestrator. At creation the trial is in the `INITIALIZING` state.

If no trial params are provided at this stage, registered [**Pre-trial hooks**](#pre-trial-hook) are called in sequence. The trial is now fully initialized and becomes `PENDING` as it wait for all the components, actors and environment to be available.

Once all the non-optional actors are available and the environment sends the initial observation set, the trial becomes `RUNNING`. If at least one non-optional actor is unavailable, it terminates right away and becomes `ENDED`.

### Trial run

As long as the trial is `RUNNING`, the Orchestrator executes **steps**:

- To each [actor](#actor), the Orchestrator sends an event, having the `ACTIVE` type, containing its observation,
- The Orchestrator then waits to receive one action per actor,
- To the [environment](#environment), the Orchestrator sends an event, having the `ACTIVE` type, containing the set of actions,
- The Orchestrator then waits to receive the set of observations from the environment.

### Trial end

#### Trial ended by the environment

This is the normal way for a trial to end.

1. The [environment](#environment) sends the final observation set, using the [session's `end` method](../reference/python.md#endself-final_observations).
2. The trial state is set to `TERMINATING`.
3. Observations are sent to the [actors](#actor) with the event type `ENDING`. [Rewards](#rewards) and [messages](#messages) sent before that point will sent to their destination; later ones will not.
4. Once all the last events are received, the Orchestrator sends a event of type `FINAL` to all the components.
5. The trial becomes `ENDED`.

#### Soft termination

Soft termination can be triggered either **by the user**, using the [Controller](#start-and-terminate-trials) or **after a maximum number of steps**, if the trial Parameter [`max_steps`](../reference/parameters.md#parameters-reference) is set.

1. The Orchestrator waits until it receives the next action set from the [actors](#actor).
2. The trial state is set to `TERMINATING`.
3. Actions are sent to the [environment](#environment) with the event type `ENDING`.
4. From this point on the flow is the same as when the trial is [ended by the environment](#trial-ended-by-the-environment).

:::note

After a soft termination is initiated (i.e. after receiving an event of type `ENDING`), the next set of observations sent by the environment will always be the last one (i.e. using [`end`](../reference/python.md#endself-final_observations) or [`produce_observation`](../reference/python.md#produce_observationsself-observations) will have the same behavior).

:::

#### Hard termination

Hard termination can be triggered in multiple ways:

- **By the user**, using the [Controller](#start-and-terminate-trials).
- **Because of unavailable actors**. If a required (non-optional) actor becomes unavailable (for any reason), the trial will be terminated (see [Actor Availability](#actor-availability)).
- **Because of inactivity**. If a component (actor, environment, pre-trial hook, etc) does not respond, the trial will be waiting and be inactive. If the trial is inactive for too long (see [Parameter `max_inactivity`](../reference/parameters.md#parameters-reference)), it will be terminated. With actor components this may happen when the timeout is too long (or indefinite) then the actor never becomes unavailable (see [Actor Availability](#actor-availability)) and the trial will keep waiting for it.
- **Because of a critical error**.

In all this cases:

1. The trial becomes `TERMINATING`.
2. The Orchestrator sends a event of type `FINAL` to all the components.
3. The trial becomes `ENDED`.
