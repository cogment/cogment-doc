# Community

If you have questions about Cogment, a project you are working on or would like to start with Cogment, or would like to become more involved in the open-source development of Cogment, we invite you to join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/QDxb9Fweqr). Here members of the Cogment community can come together to chat by voice or text, ask questions, and share solutions. We look forward to connecting with you!

## Interact with Us

We'd love to hear from you about any project you're working on with Cogment or
[Cogment Verse](https://github.com/cogment/cogment-verse). Reach out on the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/QDxb9Fweqr) to discuss your project, report any bugs you might find, or propose any fixes you think might improve our platform.

### Reporting Bugs

If you do need to report a bug, you can do so on the issues page for [Cogment](https://github.com/cogment/cogment/issues) or [Cogment Verse](https://github.com/cogment/cogment-verse/issues). It's useful to check this list first to see if your issue has been raised already before submitting a new one.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of cogment are you using (check using `cogment version`)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

### Security Disclosures

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Any security issues should be submitted directly to [dev+security@ai-r.com](mailto:dev+security@ai-r.com). In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

-   Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
-   Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at [dev+security@ai-r.com](mailto:dev+security@ai-r.com).
