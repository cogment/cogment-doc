#### Experiments Management

Monitor and manage reproducible experiments, thanks to:

-   A powerful configuration management system, including hyperparameters and seeds, built on [Hydra](https://hydra.cc).
-   Streamlined experiment tracking using [mlflow](https://mlflow.org).
-   Trained model versioning and storage via the [Cogment Model Registry](../../../../docs/reference/cli/model-registry).
-   Episode data management from the [Cogment Trial Datastore](../../../../docs/reference/cli/trial-datastore/trial-datastore-server).
