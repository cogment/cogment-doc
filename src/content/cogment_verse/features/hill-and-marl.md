#### HILL and MARL Training

Our SDK includes base implementations for multiple RL algorithms such as DQN, TD3, A2C and PPO for both single- and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). For human-in-the-loop learning, Cogment Verse includes different paradigms like learning from demonstrations (behavior cloning), learning from human interventions, and learning from explicit human feedback (RLHF). More importantly, the SDK makes it easy to implement any asynchronous centralized training / decentralized execution algorithm.
