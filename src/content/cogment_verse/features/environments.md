#### Extensive Environment Library

The existing environment library includes the standard [OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev) environments as well as board games, card games, and other multi-agent environments from [Petting Zoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org). Other environments are gradually being added, such as [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym) or [Overcooked-AI](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai). Implementing your own interactive custom environments is also quite straightforward.
