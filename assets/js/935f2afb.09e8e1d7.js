In this step of the tutorial, we will lay out how Actors are defined in Cogment. To build out our RPS application, we will add the ability for our Actors to select actions (rather than produce empty strings).","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"guide/tutorial/advanced-tutorials/directory":{"id":"guide/tutorial/advanced-tutorials/directory","title":"Improve Operational Efficiency with a Cogment Directory for Service Discovery","description":"It is not necessary to have gone through all the previous sections to understand this part, but the code changes refer to the code in the previous step.

Rewards are a way to evaluate how an Actor performs at a task. They can be used to evaluate or compare different implementations of an Actor, or, especially in the context of Reinforcement Learning, train a model. In Cogment, both the environment and other actors can evaluate an actor. Here, we will focus on sending rewards from the environment.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"guide/tutorial/environment-in-cogment":{"id":"guide/tutorial/environment-in-cogment","title":"Step 3 - The Environment in Cogment","description":"In this step of the tutorial, we will look at what is needed to define the Environment in which Actors operate.
